### Project Overview:
**HabitRite** is a habit tracker designed to empower users to build and sustain positive habits. With features like customizable routines, reminders, and progress analytics, this project is open-sourced to welcome contributions and enrich its capabilities.

### Features and Development Areas:
**1. Frontend Development with TypeScript and JavaScript:**  
- Build a sleek UI using frameworks like React or Vue.js with TypeScript for better type safety.  
- Implement dynamic components (e.g., progress bars, calendars) with reusable and maintainable JavaScript logic.  
- Develop responsive designs and animations for a modern feel.

**2. State Management:**  
- Use tools like Redux or Zustand for managing app-wide states (e.g., user habits, progress data).  
- Handle state updates securely with TypeScript features to prevent runtime bugs.

**3. Backend Development:**  
- Create scalable REST APIs using Node.js.  
- Store user data securely in databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.  
- Write backend logic with TypeScript for enhanced stability and clarity.

**4. Habit Analytics:**  
- Create visual progress charts (e.g., weekly, monthly trends) using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.  
- Include features to track streaks, completions, and missed days.

**5. Notification System:**  
- Use browser notifications and emails to remind users of their scheduled tasks.  
- Enable integration with third-party libraries for push notifications.

**6. Accessibility & Customization:**  
- Include color themes and personal preferences for different user experiences.  
- Ensure accessibility features like screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.

**7. Contribution Opportunities:**  
- Host guidelines for contributors (e.g., TypeScript-specific standards, linting rules, issue templates).  
- Include beginner-friendly tasks to encourage learning and onboarding.
